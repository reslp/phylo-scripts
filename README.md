phylo-scripts
==============

In this repository are several small python scripts I wrote to speed up small tasks in my phylogenetic analyses.
Some are experimental and it could happen that they are even unusable for you.
Feel free to use them, but be cautious. Although they worked for me, this doesn't mean that they have been thoroughly tested.

Feel free to contact me with questions, feedback, suggestions, ...
