python scripts for phylogenetics

This repository contains several small scripts that help with creating concatenated sequences alignments from multiple single locus files.
I created these scripts to be able to quickly create alignments with different taxon samplings for phylogenetic reconstructions.





See PIPELINE_USAGE.txt from information on how this works.
