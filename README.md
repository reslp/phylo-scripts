python-scripts
==============

In this repository are several small python scripts I wrote to speed up small tasks in my phylogenetic analyses.
Some are experimental and it could happen that they are even unusable.
Feel free to use them, but be cautious. I wrote most of them very quickly and without much testing!
The folder concat contains all the scripts needed to create concatenated alignments from a desired list of taxa from multi locus data. 

Feel free to contact me with questions, feedback, suggestions, ...
