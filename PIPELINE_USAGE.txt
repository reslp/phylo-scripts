Workflow for using the concat script pipeline:


It will use sequences and scripts from the shared Dropbox folders:
original_sequence_files
and
phylo_scripts

Always make sure that IDs_used_for_tree.txt is encoded with UNIX line endings.


1. Create local directory where you would like to run the analysis.

2. Copy files get_analysis.sh and IDs_used_for_tree.txt in that dir.
	Important: get_analysis.sh assumes that your Dropbox folder is in home.
	
3. Change IDs_used_for_tree.txt to desired set of taxa.
	Important: File should not end with a blank line.
	
4. Run get_analysis.sh
	Important: mafft needs to be installed on your local machine
	
5. Run phylogenetic tree

6. Run the following command to get readable names for your tree:
	~/Dropbox/phylo_scripts/name_tree.py ~/Dropbox/original_sequence_files/readable_tree_names.txt treeinfile.tre > treeoutfile.tre
